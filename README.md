# TopoFlow
This subproject of _EngiOptiQA_ provides a framework to perform topology optimization for fluid flow problems with annealing methods such as GPU-based annealing or hybrid quantum annealing (QA).

## Overview
Initially, this repository contains the code Yudai developed in the beginning (October 2023) as a reference ([original](original) folder). The code by Shiori can currently be found in the [Lshape16](Lshape16) folder.
