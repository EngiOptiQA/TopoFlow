# TopoFlow
This subproject of _EngiOptiQA_ provides a framework to perform topology optimization for fluid flow problems with annealing methods such as GPU-based annealing or hybrid quantum annealing (QA).

## Overview
Initially, this repository contains the code that Yudai developed in the beginning (October 2023) as a reference (`original`).
